=== EBOT ===

ebot - A rework of the old manderlbot code.

The aim was to make a minimal code base tht can be included anywhere.

Any command (part from PING, which is taken cre of by ebot) has to
be implemented by the user of ebot as a plugin. Ebot my be started as:

    ebot:start_link(Data).

Where Data is a Key-Value proplist. See the priv/example.conf for
an example of recognized Key-Values. The plugin code is defined
by the matchspecs key and is a list of {IrcRegExp, {Mod,Fun}} tuples.
Whenever one (or more) of the RegExp matches what the ebot receives,
the defined callback will be called.

See the src/ebot_example.erl code for some simple callback functions
and one, somewhat more complex, callback function that is used to for
asking about the status of Jenkins jobs.

To send messages to an IRC channel use any of:

    ebot:say(Ebot, Msg, "#"++Channel).
    ebot:say(Ebot, Msg, "#"++Channel, Who).

Have fun!
